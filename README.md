### T's Brewcraft brings the best - and worst - of homebrewing to Minecraft.

...but mainly the worst.

> FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY.

> Currently in development!

## Planned Features:

**Grow Crops**

- Grapes, Barley, Hops, Corn, Rice, and Agave.

**Kegging, Distillation, Ageing**

- Any food item can be fermented, distilled, or aged. That doesn't mean it's a good idea, though.

## Just like real life,

**Everything is dangerous.**

- With homebrewing comes explosions, poisoning, fire, and much more.

**It is tedious as heck.**

- Even if you get everything right, it's still a pain. Especially bottling.

**Nothing you make is good for you.**

- Despite all that work, drinking is bad.

## So, why?

**It's all about the journey, or something.**
