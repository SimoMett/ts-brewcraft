### T's Brewcraft brings the best - and worst - of homebrewing to Minecraft.

...but mainly the worst.

> Currently in development, VERY broken and unfinished!

## Planned Features:

**Grow Crops**

- Grapes, Barley, Hops, Corn, Rice, and Agave

**Kegging, Distillation, Ageing**

- Adds a keg block that allows _any_ food item to be fermented, distilled, or aged.

    (Whether that's a good idea is another story)

**Bottling and packaging**

- Get your fermented things into bottles for everyone to enjoy!

**Unwanted surprises!**

- Not only does this \*not\* come with a manual, you're going to find _everything_ out the hard way.

## Just like real life,

**Everything is dangerous.**

- With homebrewing comes spills, poisoning, explosions, and much more.

**It is tedious and frustrating.**

- Everything you do will be arduous.

**Nothing you make is good for you.**

- Despite all that work, drinking is bad.

## So, why?

**It's all about the journey, or something.**

Or maybe you're a masochist. Proceed at your own risk.
